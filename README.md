# Bangalore-House-Prediction
This is a web app which is used to predict the price for an apartment in Banglore taking BHK,Location,Area per square Feet and number of Bathrooms as input and predicting price<br />
I have used Linear Regression for my ml model and Flask majorly for my app building<br />
Steps to run this app<br />
Clone this repositry<br />
Install requirements.txt in terminal for installing all libraries<br />
Use 'flask run' to run your app<br />
It will show incorrect data if wrong inputs are given<br />
I have attached a video on how my app will work!<br />
