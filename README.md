# <a name="price-prediction"></a>Bangalore House Price Prediction
In this project, I have developed a web application using Flask and Bootstrap for apartment price prediction in Bangalore. The code utilizes ridge regression to make predictions based on various input features such as location, total square feet area, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms. Bootstrap is used for templating, providing a responsive and visually appealing design to the web application. The Flask framework is used to create a user-friendly interface where users can input the necessary information and get a predicted price for the apartment. The application takes the input data, preprocesses it, and passes it through the trained ridge regression model to generate a prediction. The predicted price is then displayed to the user in a Bootstrap-styled format. Flask and Bootstrap together provide a powerful combination for building interactive and visually appealing web applications.
